  Creating AWS cloudformation templates just got easy!! CloudKast is a UI based AWS cloudformation 
  template generator. It provides insighful description <mat-icon>info</mat-icon> for each property 
  of AWS resources e.g. valid values it can hold, whether required, conditional or optional. Properties that are custom objects are available to be created and edited 
  using 'Property Dealer' <mat-icon>edit</mat-icon>  that is accessible against each property. 'Function
  manager' is a helper utility to generate intrinsic functions on the go. Each AWS resource is provided 
  with a <mat-icon>file_copy</mat-icon> that allows copying the resource's JSON. The generated 
  cloudformation template can also be validated against an AWS account by providing AWS credentials.

  Parsing JSON-formatted text files to see the resources that are in your template and their relationships can be difficult.
  When you author template resources in a text editor, you must manually edit JSON or YAML, which can be tedious and error-prone.
  By using CloudKast, you spend less time manually coding your templates and more time designing your AWS infrastructure.
