  Creating AWS cloudformation templates just got easy!! CloudKast is a 
  web-based <b>'jsonfree'</b>  (no need to write any cumbersome json) and
  <b>insightful</b>  (property description and valid values available for 
  each property of each resource or section in a cloudformation template so that you don't have to get
  lost in cloudformation documentation) AWS cloudformation editor (more like an IDE caterred to AWS 
  cloudformation)  <b>for busy developers</b>  (creating a working template is way much quicker now whether you 
  are a junior developer or an architect. Now you can focus more on architecting your environment).

<p mat-body >
  Parsing JSON- or YAML-formatted text files to see the resources that are in your template and their relationships can be difficult.
  When you author template resources in a text editor, you must manually edit JSON or YAML, which can be tedious and error-prone.
  By using CloudKast, you spend less time manually coding your templates and more time designing your AWS infrastructure.
