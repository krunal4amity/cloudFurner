  Authoring AWS CloudFormation templates is a dreadful task (and so is writing any long piece of complex
  json or yaml for that matter).   Parsing JSON-formatted text files to see the resources that are in your template and their relationships can be difficult.
  When you author template resources in a text editor, you must manually edit JSON or YAML, which can be tedious and error-prone.
This has led to emergence of many enterprise and community driven tools in the market over the last few years. These tools can be broadly
divided into the following categories:
<mat-list role="list">
    <li>IDE plugins e.g. Jetbrains plugin for CloudFormation etc.</li>
    <li>GUI based tools e.g. AWS CloudFormation designer</li>
    <li>DSLs e.g. GoFormation, cfndsl, SparkleFormation, Troposphere etc.</li>
  </mat-list>
  All these existing tools, however useful, end up pushing up the entry barrier even higher and thus 
  fall short in one criterion: <i>Quick Adaptability.</i>
